Hi there!

I'm Pablo, a multi-skilled Agricultural Engineer with a Plant Breeding MSc and +10 years of experience in the Plant & Seed Science sector. 
Currently working as a Seed Biology Lab. Technician at the [Millennium Seed Bank](https://www.kew.org/wakehurst/whats-at-wakehurst/millennium-seed-bank) (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) doing laboratory maintenance, specialized training & seed science (germination, phenotyping, data analysis and statistics via R & Fiji/ImageJ).  
Sometimes I even find some time to write about it!
